here are some example CONSpiracy compedia.

mind they are not _programs_, (though soon you'll be able to generate programs from them). this also means they are not meant to be executed via conspiracy-interactive; you can test them in there, but they are quite slow.


some really silly examples:
- [trivial.cpr](trivial.cpr) -- just some basic use cases demonstrated
- [merge-sort.cpr](merge-sort.cpr) -- uninteresting description of merge sort
- [lists.cpr](lists.cpr) -- classical operations on lists...


plus some sketchy implementations of various programming languages (each one written <1h and <100loc):
- [fcl-numerical.cpr](fcl-numerical.cpr) -- a simple flowchart language
- [post-machine.cpr](post-machine.cpr) -- right/left, mark/erase, jump [un]conditionally
- [bf-to-c.cpr](bf-to-c.cpr) -- super-primitive brain**FUCK** to C compiler

- [mccarthy-lisp.cpr](mccarthy-lisp.cpr) -- a short lesson of history
- [modern-lisp.cpr](modern-lisp.cpr) -- lexically scoping pure lisp

- [drcz0.cpr](drcz0.cpr) -- dynamically scoped tiny lisp
- [drc-machine.cpr](drc-machine.cpr) -- my good old stack machine
- [drcz0->drc.cpr](drcz0->drc.cpr) -- a ridiculously tiny compiler from drcz0 to DRC

- [micro-conspiracy.cpr](micro-conspiracy.cpr) -- µCONSpiracy, a subset of CONSpiracy implemented in itself
- [micro-consequence.cpr](micro-consequence.cpr) -- µCONSequence, a tiny pattern-matching language /intermediate form for µCONSpiracy/. includes DRC machine implemented in µCONSequence!

- [s-graph.cpr](s-graph.cpr) -- /an experiment in different style/ Gluck&Klimov's tiny language from 1993 paper ``Occam's razor in metacomputation''


and some math:
- [peano.cpr](peano.cpr) -- toying with Peano numerals
- [disjunctive-normal-form.cpr](disjunctive-normal-form.cpr) -- not very impressive conversion of sentential formulas to DNF
- [sets.cpr](sets.cpr) -- some set-theoretical constructions (for groups.cpr)
- [groups.cpr](groups.cpr) -- CONSpiracy classic, an introduction to group theory
